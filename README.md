# SyncUp Project - CS3354.005 Group 5
_By Students for Students for all your Scheduling needs._
## Intro
**SyncUp** is a platform designed by students for students to make coordination and schedule planning much easier.  Whether it's balancing group hangouts, study sessions, or simply just club meetings, SyncUp makes it simple to align schedules and stay connected.

## Scope
The project involves developing a calendar-based scheduling app that allows students to link their school accounts using their student ID or email to import class schedules automatically. The app will enable users to add friends from their school, view shared availability, and compare schedules to find overlapping free time for socializing, studying, or group work.

### Key features
1. calendar syncing
2. permission-based visibility of schedules
3. smart suggestions for common free periods
4. privacy controls to manage who can view a userâ€™s availability.
5. and more!

### Calendar integration
The app will integrate with school systems where possible, support manual input for institutions that are not supported, and prioritize data security and user privacy in compliance with educational data standards.
